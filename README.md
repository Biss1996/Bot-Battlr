# Bot Battlr

Bot Battlr is a web application that allows users to browse a collection of robots (bots), build an army by enlisting bots, release bots from their army, and discharge bots forever by deleting them. The application uses React for the frontend and json-server as the backend to fetch and manage bot data.

## Features

- View a list of all available bots in the **BotCollection**.
- Enlist bots to your **YourBotArmy** by clicking on them.
- Release bots from your army by clicking on them in the **YourBotArmy** component.
- Discharge bots permanently by clicking the red "x" button, which deletes the bot both from the frontend and backend.
- Fetch data from a local JSON server.

## Installation

## Technologies Used
